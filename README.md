# Jordan-Freundlich-Portfolio

Hi! I am Jordan Freundlich. 

I am a youth worker turned full stack developer. For the last decade I worked in the non-profit world. My job was to help young people through one of the hardest problems of life; growing up. Through my work as a curriculum writer and designer of year long programming, I have found a love for using creativity to solve complex problems. I bring energy, joy and community building to any team.
